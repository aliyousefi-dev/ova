we should think about the admin panel and how this shoul works 

we need to implement two things
the one is how we can run the front end and the 

first when we upload a file then it show the progress for processing the video. and adding that to 
i don't know what is good for doing this.

and we can delete the video 


how we can add new user also. we need to see the users and also 
have buttons for adding the user .

also we need the logic for changing the password on the profile 


i think it best to tag some timeline for hot times.
i think about the Smart Playlist .

Keep `localstorage` focused on storing/loading/managing data.
`localstorage` calls `metadata.ExtractVideoMetadata` when it needs video info.

and when i want use any commadn check the repostiroy valid or not 
or use another method that the folder create when need like when run the commadn ovacli cook vtss all
