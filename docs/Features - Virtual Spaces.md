Virtual Spaces.
the Virtual Spaces is not connected to any Disk.
you can link the videos to this spaces without reupload them again.
It Acts as Playlists

- Supports Quality Controls

I want Each Spaces Support Some this that holds sub folders.

Each Spaces Support the Groups.

You Can make a Spaces and Create Groups on that.
By Default IT have a Root Group.

Also we have a Root Spaces.
That Holds the other Spaces.

Its Always Publics
and Show all Spaces and Videos on that.
But some Spaces is Locked.
And for Joining to that Spaces You need an Expirable Invite Link or Having the Join Password.
