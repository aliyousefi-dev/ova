  A modular service that processes videos automatically through a workflow, e.g.:

--- Processing video: xxxx ---  
[INFO] Running video processor service...  
[INFO] VTTs generated for video 'xxxx'.  
[INFO] Thumbnail generated for 'xxxx'.  
[INFO] Preview generated for 'xxxx'.  
[INFO] Video processor service finished.  
[INFO] Video data added to database.  
[SUCCESS] Video 'xxxx' successfully added to storage.

--- Processing video: xxxx2 ---  
[INFO] Running video processor service...  
[INFO] VTTs generated for video 'xxxx2'.  
[INFO] Thumbnail generated for 'xxxx2'.  
[ERROR] Failed to generate preview for 'xxxx2'.  
[INFO] Cancelling video processor service...  
[INFO] Deleting generated VTTs...  
[INFO] Deleting generated thumbnails...  
[INFO] Video processor service finished.  
[INFO] Video data added to database.  
[SUCCESS] Video 'xxxx2' successfully added to storage.
