we need to create a local Route System 
that start with the root/lskjdf

it convert that liink to a file route path
liek thi s

root/newfolder
to 

newfolder

we need a way to add the video ids to the indexed spaces when 
indexing the video 

how we can doing this ? 


we have a video id path that is this 

newfolder/testfolder/test/video.mp4
it segment that to newfolder space 
and then going to the group test folder and again going to the test group and add the video id to that 

addvideoidtospace(videoid,filepath)
removevideoidfromspace(vidoeid,filepath)


the other method is it get the space 
then update that
