why we need the indexing the spaces ? 
is that good or not ? 

what prounce

does we need the separate the spaces for the users ? 

how the indexing working ? 

when running the server.
it scan the disk. find the spaces.
but each spaces have owner what about if a space deos not have owner.

a space can be public or private.
by default all spaces all private.

i can only see my spaces.

other wise the space be public.

the virtual spaces enable to without copy files again link tha to another spaces.
lock for edit or deletation.

the team space give this ability
