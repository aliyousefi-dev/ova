i thinking more about the ova desktop i think about how we can merge two functionality for serve and also the Show.

Connection
Close Connection 


the desktop is a bit different it like the game that have create server or connect to server.

New Server 
Connect 
Select A Folder that Videos on that.


We need thinking more about the app and the Desktop app.
Add Server
Open Server
Create Server
Manage Servers


The Desktop have own Navbar 
and the mobile have Own Connection Page

The Theme Selector going duplicate on the Desktop and WebView

Shortcuts in the Desktop app 

Ctrl + F .. Search on the Videos.
Ctrl + N 
Ctrl + K Open Settings 

i think the native is better 

Set as Default Server
