ok now we need index by space from space.
get all videos from space

The Space just holds the Video 

A Fresh Space is just added the Video IDs.
it not have the Disk Path.

Each Video IDs by own have the DiskPath.

on the recents we have also both the new spaces added and another tab tha tshow the global new video added.

The Global Video added use the videos.js file that contain all video data.
and the recent spaces use the spaces.js that hold all spaces.

i Thinking how handle the duplications on the spaces.
must each space have own visibility ? 

for example one same video can uploaded to different spaces without the duplication indexing error?

Also have a Limit that what is Max Spaces a User Can Create.

That Return the Spaces.

Indexing the Spaces.

Loop
